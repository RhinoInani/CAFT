Today STEM disciplines are the dominant programs in American schools. Students are under enormous pressure to major in science and technology, and we are constantly being told that this is the wave of the future. The humanities are definitely falling out of favor. What is the use of humanities anyway? Will humanities majors be able to get a job? And the field of Classics seems especially old-fashioned – even the name ‘Classics’ comes across as elitist, out of touch with the modern world. Who cares about a bunch of dead stuff from thousands of years ago? What is the point of studying Classics in the twenty-first century?

And yet, interest in Greek and Roman antiquity somehow endures. Maybe it is the continuing fascination with Greek mythology in popular culture. From Harry Potter to Percy Jackson, the myths of the Greeks and Romans continue to provide a model for contemporary storytelling. For those who delve further into Greek and Latin literature, there are incredible moments of enrichment and enlightenment as we confront the continuing patterns of human existence. The grief and pathos of the widows and orphans in Homer’s Iliad and Euripides’s Trojan Women could be the victims of war in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Ukraine. The satires of overstuffed, pompous politicians in the comedies of Aristophanes seem to be describing many of our leaders today. The passion and heartbreak of the love affair of Aeneas and Dido find their own echoes in broken romances of our own generation. Classics may not be fashionable, but the study of the Greek and Roman past still has the ability to touch our souls and teach us much about the human condition. Whether you are a STEM major seeking to know humankind better or simply someone who loves history and storytelling, Classics has much to offer.
